            <p>1. <strong class="row-title">Volatility:</strong> The 
prices of digital assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the 
price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the 
digital assets, which may also be subject to significant price 
volatility. It cannot be guaranteed that any purchasers of digital 
assets will not lose money.</p>

solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your 
digital assets’ transactions. Neither Swftc nor any other Swftc 
Party is responsible for determining the taxes that apply to Digital 
Assets transactions.</p>
            <p>3. <strong class="row-title">Inherent risks while exchanging Digital Assets:</strong>
 There are risks associated with transacting with Blockchain-based 
assets such as Digital Assets, including but not limited to, the risk of
 hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious 
software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain 
unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept
 and acknowledge that Swftc will not be responsible for any 
communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions, or delays you 
may experience when using the Digital Assets, however, caused. The 
regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, 
and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially 
adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of 
Digital Assets.</p>
            <p>4. <strong class="row-title">Service Depending on Third-Party Service Providers:</strong>
 The Service relies on third-party platforms to perform certain

            <p>5. <strong class="row-title">No Warranty regarding the Digital Assets and Swftc’s rights to restrict usage of a Digital Asset:</strong>
 There are risks, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing 
counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to 
metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may
 become untransferable. Swftc reserves the right to hide collections,
 contracts, and assets affected by any of these issues or by other 
issues. Assets you purchase may become inaccessible on Swftc. Under 
no circumstances shall the inability to view your assets on Swftc 
serve as grounds for a claim against Swftc.</p>

negligence), breach of contract or otherwise, even if foreseeable and 
even if Swftc has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of

 system, date/time stamps, and clickstream data. We use this information
 to analyze trends, administer the Service, track users’ movements 
around the Service, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. 
For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you
